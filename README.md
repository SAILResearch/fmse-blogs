## 4. **üîÑ Reproduce**

The `Dockerfile` in this directory has been used to create the docker image `fmse_blogs_image.tgz` using this command:

```bash
docker build -t fmse_blogs .
```

If you have downloaded the `fmse_blogs_image.tgz` file, you can load it into your Docker environment using the following command in your terminal, from the directory containing the `.tgz` file:

```bash
docker load -i fmse_blogs_image.tgz 
```

and run via 
```
docker run -it -v"${PWD}/output":"/app/output" fmse_blogs
```
